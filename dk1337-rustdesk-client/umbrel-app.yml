  RustDesk is an open-source remote access and desktop solution that offers a compelling alternative to commercial applications like TeamViewer. One of RustDesk's standout features is the ability to fully self-host the software, giving users complete control over their data without relying on external servers. This is particularly advantageous for businesses and individuals who prioritize privacy and security.


  RustDesk provides a wide range of useful features, including file transfer, session recording, and detailed access controls, allowing users to effectively monitor and manage usage. Its decentralized architecture enables users to leverage their own infrastructure, making the solution highly flexible. RustDesk is ideal for secure and efficient remote access, offering a high level of usability for those seeking a stable, private, and reliable remote desktop software.
